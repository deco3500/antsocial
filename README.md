##Summary
Locals is an online community web application that groups people based on the location/suburb that they live in. In these groups, the users are also split into different subgroups based on their interest such as sport, entertainment, business, culture and life. News that are related to that location/suburb will be posted to that group so people can get up-to-date information on what is happening around them. The user is also able to express their opinion or leave feedback in the web application. Other than news, the user can also post other messages to the web application such as garage sales, lost items or advertisements etc. on the web application for the local community.
“Armed with easy-to-use Web publishing tools, always-on connections and increasingly powerful mobile devices, the online audience has the means to become an active participant in the creation and dissemination of news and information.” (WeMedia) Locals not only present local news in a traditional way, but one of its major functionalities is that users post what they see in the news and express their opinions to share with others. It turns users into journalists in reporting news, which largely increases the news amount that users get to read.
“To comprehend journalistic value creation we need to focus on the benefits it provides.”(Why journalists deserve low pay) Nowadays, as most of the news websites focus on the content of the news, this web application focuses on the place/area in which the news/event happened and delivers this information to the user group. One of the benefits in using this application is the ability to receive news events that were not reported by the mainstream news media and receive instant updates from the people in the local area.  

#Design Process
###Research
####Research 1:
IT and social media consumption is increasing, resulting in the growth of citizen journalism. According a study of 200 blogs, Kerr et al. (2012), identified that blogs and online social media sites provided online users the power to influence and share their opinion with like-minded users. Furthermore, they found that online platforms increased the number of citizen journalists but formed an absence of impartiality.

Within decades, mobile phones have gone from calling devices to multitalented tools that complement consumers’ ability to function. Today, they can call, text, email, post, and video through the internet. The Internet has evolved from a platform originally used to facilitate info-exchanging to a suitcase of social-networks that offer virtual-content-sharing (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). It is here where technology has transformed the way journalists, institutions and consumers distribute and receive news. In fact, social media is no longer being embraced for it’s traditional use. If you go into Google and search ‘Journalism apps’, the results will shows several headings along the lines of ‘Top 10 apps that every Journalist should have’.

Mobile devices have become a common way for consumers to source information and data. Traditionally, this was achieved through online governmental or other institutional databases such as The National Archives’ Digital Archive of Data Sites. The sites originally provided users to only obtain information that was formatted. However, the sites now host forums to discuss their use of data and further relevant information. This has provided an element of interactivity, which has been well explored and used through other platforms.
According to Bradshaw & Rohumaa (2011), live data has become a useful tool for journalists to obtain information. The difference between such data is that it is not stored anywhere but is produced at a particular time, which can be useful in certain contexts. For example, newspapers are increasingly using Twitter commentary to provide background information to a debate that is current at the time.

This is certainly true in the data above that shows the social media platforms consumers use to source information on political and governmental activities in the US in 2014. As shown, Facebook was the number one site that online users relied on for receiving such news. However, a dilemma arises from this dependence on social media applications, which Bradshaw has summarized in the following questions:
- How will users filter these platforms to obtain news that is relevant and significant?
- How can information be visualized most clearly?
- How can you ensured that these platforms are not being intentionally skewed for commercial or political reasons?
- How much do you love to leave comments below the news?

####Research 2: Public Record Survey Questionnaire
The link to the survey that aims to view users’ thoughts about the accessibility of news. It will provide some insight into this issue, and if Locals would be suitable product solution.

##Current offerings:
“Locals” dedicates to provide information sorted in categories, on regional basis, and to encourage users to be the reporters by publishing comments or posting news/events. A popular news web application, BuzzFeed also allows users to customize the categories of news/articles to read. Locals provides a similar functionality as to BuzzFeed as it also sort news into categories which users may choose to read. However, BuzzFeed does not allow users to select locations of where the news occurred nor search for a specific news event in specific areas. 

###Problem Identification
- Limited source of receiving news -- mainstream news media.
- Difficult to receive news in surrounding areas -- unless something huge happens and reported by the media.
- One-way communication -- people read the news, but no interactions can be done.
- Most of the online news platforms are designed in ordinary ways.
- As most of the news events are formal, it takes time for the journalist to write up and publish the news event.

##Target audience and context of use
###Target audience 
“Locals” are aimed at people who wanted to know what news/events happening in their surrounding area and are keen to share their views with others towards the news/events. For example, these people can be students who wanted to know what events are happening in their school/uni. They can open the web application, register/sign in,  choose the location of their school/uni and view the news/events according to their interest by clicking the pins on Google map. If there are any news/events that they are interested in, they can also share their opinion about the new/event by clicking on the comment button. These students can also create new post if they see anything that they think is fun or significant and would like to share to the public. 


People who drives to work and wanted to know about the traffic conditions in certain regions can also use the app after choosing the region and selecting “Lifestyle” as the news category to read about the traffic news in that area. They can also post traffic news of their current locations to benefit other drivers. 


Travellers can also use the app to see what is happening in the place where they plan to visit by selecting the pin in Google Map and browsing through the news list. They can read the comments that are posted by other users to see how the locals view/opinion on a certain event/news.  

The persona below represents our intended users as it was developed by the research performed on common attributes of our target audiences.

##Requirement Analysis
We have collected a lot of raw data and initial personas from research phase and in requirement analysis phase. We would analyze such statistics further in order to get universal and comprehensive requirements of the user. 

##Conceptual Design
###Concept
The idea of this project is to provide a medium for the local community to communicate and share news and opinions. As most of the news websites focus on an international/national perspective, Locals focuses on providing up-to-date news in the local area for people that is living in that area. One of the benefits of using Locals is that the users get a chance to know the people that are living in the same area.

###Conceptual Model
Locals is a web application that is based on Google Map, focusing on new communication methods in local areas. The major technique of this project is the connection of different APIs from different resources such as Google Earth for web map and Facebook, Twitter and other news publishers for news data.The data collected will be analysed and logical filters will be used to allocate certain news events to corresponding areas. As for the user interaction, rich exploration in terms of interaction mode were provided for users with the support of drag-and-drop, zoom-in/zoom-out by scrolling on the mouse gives the user different interaction methods when using the application. The core question is on how to augment the communication between users in providing a personal news post mechanism in which users could post their news from the Locals platform as the supplementary news resources apart from other mainstream publishers. 
The users can also share posts from the Locals platform to social websites such as Facebook or Twitter to increase engagement and attract other users from different channels. People should use this web application as it combines news from different sources about a particular suburb/area without the need to search using specific keywords of the suburb/area on different news websites.
###Framework Design
####Functions
- Login, Register, Forgot Password, and Logout.
- Google Map which can be zoomed in or out on a specific area. 
- Transparent circles displayed on Google Map shows the news’ region contour, the larger the circle, the more news that are contained in the region.
- The user can read the outline of the news events by clicking on the pins with different letters that represents different categories of news. Users can click on the link provided in the outline to read the full list of news contained in the category. 
- Users can click on any news events in the forum list to view its detail, location and where the article was posted as shown in the form of Google Map. 
- Users can leave comments under each news event post in the forum. The comment made can be purely text or with pictures attached. The user also gets an option to display the current location of where the comment was made. 
- Users can create new post by using the new post function. It is required to enter the title and content of the post. The post can be purely text or with pictures attached. The user also gets an option to display the current location of where the post was made. 
- A news library which contains all the news category in the local area.
- An About Us page about the developer team behind Locals.
###Design of the prototype
Design draft 1
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
This is the main page of our web application, at the start of our design process, we used Google map along with a red pin on the map to represent the news events. 

Design draft 2
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
At our second design phase, we decided to use black as our theme colour and used circles instead of pins to represent news events.

Final Design
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
This is the login page for our web application. The user can register, login or reset their password in this page. After logging in, it will direct user to the main page. 
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
This page is accessed when the user forgets the account password, and clicks on “Forgot Password?” button on the login page. Email address of the registered account is required to be entered. The user then clicks on the “Reset Password” button. An email will be sent to the user’s email address, providing a link to reset password. After the user clicks on the link and enter the new password, he/she will be able to login using the same password.  
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
Register page requires the user to enter details including Name, Contact Number, Email Address, Username and Password. After all fields are filled in, user clicks on “Register” button to complete the registration process and continue to use the functions provided by the website.
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
At the final stage of our design, we decided to use different colour pins along with different letters to represent different news events. S for sport, L for life, E for entertainment, B for business and C for culture, The user can hover their mouse over the pins to see what each letter represents. The transparent circle represents the news’ region contour. The user can click on the pins to retrieve more information about the event. The top stories will then be displayed at the pop-up window. There is also a link on the pop-up window which directs the user to the forum page. 
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
This is the forum page of our web application, This page contains all the news that are related to the category that user has selected. The user can click on the post to retrieve more information about the event. The user can also create a new post by clicking on the new post button. The user can click the return button to return to the main page.
