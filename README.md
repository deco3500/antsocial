##Summary
Locals is an online community web application that groups people based on the location/suburb that they live in. In these groups, the users are also split into different subgroups based on their interest such as sport, entertainment, business, culture and life. News that are related to that location/suburb will be posted to that group so people can get up-to-date information on what is happening around them. The user is also able to express their opinion or leave feedback in the web application. Other than news, the user can also post other messages to the web application such as garage sales, lost items or advertisements etc. on the web application for the local community.
“Armed with easy-to-use Web publishing tools, always-on connections and increasingly powerful mobile devices, the online audience has the means to become an active participant in the creation and dissemination of news and information.” (WeMedia) Locals not only present local news in a traditional way, but one of its major functionalities is that users post what they see in the news and express their opinions to share with others. It turns users into journalists in reporting news, which largely increases the news amount that users get to read.
“To comprehend journalistic value creation we need to focus on the benefits it provides.”(Why journalists deserve low pay) Nowadays, as most of the news websites focus on the content of the news, this web application focuses on the place/area in which the news/event happened and delivers this information to the user group. One of the benefits in using this application is the ability to receive news events that were not reported by the mainstream news media and receive instant updates from the people in the local area.  

###Research
####Research 1:
IT and social media consumption is increasing, resulting in the growth of citizen journalism. According a study of 200 blogs, Kerr et al. (2012), identified that blogs and online social media sites provided online users the power to influence and share their opinion with like-minded users. Furthermore, they found that online platforms increased the number of citizen journalists but formed an absence of impartiality.

Within decades, mobile phones have gone from calling devices to multitalented tools that complement consumers’ ability to function. Today, they can call, text, email, post, and video through the internet. The Internet has evolved from a platform originally used to facilitate info-exchanging to a suitcase of social-networks that offer virtual-content-sharing (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). It is here where technology has transformed the way journalists, institutions and consumers distribute and receive news. In fact, social media is no longer being embraced for it’s traditional use. If you go into Google and search ‘Journalism apps’, the results will shows several headings along the lines of ‘Top 10 apps that every Journalist should have’.

Mobile devices have become a common way for consumers to source information and data. Traditionally, this was achieved through online governmental or other institutional databases such as The National Archives’ Digital Archive of Data Sites. The sites originally provided users to only obtain information that was formatted. However, the sites now host forums to discuss their use of data and further relevant information. This has provided an element of interactivity, which has been well explored and used through other platforms.
According to Bradshaw & Rohumaa (2011), live data has become a useful tool for journalists to obtain information. The difference between such data is that it is not stored anywhere but is produced at a particular time, which can be useful in certain contexts. For example, newspapers are increasingly using Twitter commentary to provide background information to a debate that is current at the time.

This is certainly true in the data above that shows the social media platforms consumers use to source information on political and governmental activities in the US in 2014. As shown, Facebook was the number one site that online users relied on for receiving such news. However, a dilemma arises from this dependence on social media applications, which Bradshaw has summarized in the following questions:
- How will users filter these platforms to obtain news that is relevant and significant?
- How can information be visualized most clearly?
