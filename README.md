#Introduction
Locals is an online community web application that groups people based on the location/suburb that they live in, in these groups, the users are also split into different subgroups based on their age. News that are related to that location/suburb will be posted to that group so people can get up-to-date information on what is happening around them. The user is also able to give feedback to the sender using this web application. Other then news, the user can also post other messages to the web application such as garage sales, lost items or advertisements etc. on the web application for the local community. By using this web application, the user also gets a chance to know the people around them.
Locals helps the local community to spread news that are related to the local area. This web application provides a medium for the people to spread their opinions or ideas online. Nowadays, as mosts of the news websites focuses on the content of the news, this web application focuses on the place/area in which the news/event happened and delivers these information to the user group.

#Concept

The idea of this project is to provide a medium for the local community to communicate and share news and opinions. As most of the news websites focus on a international/national perspective, Locals focuses on providing news in the local area. One of the benefits of using Locals is that the users gets a chance to know the people that is living around them. 

This project aims to provide up-to-date news to the local community for the people that is living in the area. People can also provide any feedback or opinion they have about the news. News content will be generated from news websites such as news.com.au, yahoo news, fairfax etc. The system will scan the article for suburb names that are saved in the database and the system will create posts according to the suburb the event happened. User can also share posts on social websites such as Facebook or Twitter to increase engagement and attract other users on different channels. People should use this web application as it combines news from different sources about a particular suburb without the need to search using specific keywords of the suburb on news websites. 


As mentioned above, most of the news websites nowadays focuses on a bigger perspective while Locals focuses on specific suburbs. As most of the news website only share information, Locals also provides a method for the users to have a say on what they think.
