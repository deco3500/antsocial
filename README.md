##Introduction
The project that our team has chosen is Locals. Locals is an online community web application that groups people based on the location/suburb that they live in, in these groups, the users are also split into different subgroups based on their interest such as sport, technology and lifestyle etc. In order to facilitate the user, Locals also provide a mobile platform for the user. News that are related to that location/suburb will be posted to that group so people can get up-to-date information on what is happening around them. The user is also able to express their opinion or leave feedback in the web application. Other than news, the user can also post other messages to the web application such as garage sales, lost items or advertisements etc. on the web application for the local community.

Nowadays, as most of the news websites focus on the content of the news, this web application focuses on the place/area in which the news/event happened and delivers this information to the user group.

##Concept
The idea of this project is to provide a medium for the local community to communicate and share news and opinions. As most of the news websites focus on an international/national perspective, Locals focuses on providing up-to-date news in the local area for people that is living in that area. One of the benefits of using Locals is that the users get a chance to know the people that are living around them.

Conceptual model
The Locals is a website application that is based on the Google Map, focusing on new communication in local areas. The major technique of this project is the connection of different kinds of API from different resources such as Google Earth for web map and Facebook, Twitter and other news publishers for the raw data of news. Then we would try to analyze the raw data we get and use logical filters to allocate certain news to corresponding areas. As for the user interaction, we would provide rich exploration in term of interaction mode for users which means we would support drag and drop in the map so that users could explore anything as we want. The core question is that, how to augment the communication between users, so we would provide the personal news post mechanism which users could post their news from our platform as the supplementary news resources apart from other mainstream publishers. The user can also share posts on social websites such as Facebook or Twitter to increase engagement and attract other users from different channels. People should use this web application as it combines news from different sources about a particular suburb without the need to search using specific keywords of the suburb on news websites.

##Team
Our current team members consist Sin Man Simao Chan (Simon), Cheng Hang (Wilbur), Bei Jia Li (Rebecca) and Chen Xue (Scott).

Simon and Wilbur are master students studying information technology and interaction design (DECO7350) while Rebecca and Scott are bachelor students studying information technology (DECO3500).

Wilbur will be the team leader and facilitate meetings twice a week. Simon will be responsible for the logistics such as the equipment that is needed. Wilbur and Simon will be in charge of the front-end content and design, while Rebecca and Scott will be in charge of the back-end content. Decisions will be made during meetings. If there is a dispute the team will vote to make the final decision. The team leader will have two votes. Team members that have trouble in meeting deadlines are necessary to report to the team leader for further actions. The team leader will try to resolve conflicts when conflict arises. If conflict continues to worsen in the group, the team leader will talk to the member individually to gain a better perspective of the situation and explore ways to control the situation.


##Communication
Our group has come to an agreement of coming to the lectures and the practical sessions on Monday (10:00-12:00) and Friday (14:00-16:00). A one-hour meeting will be held in the Hawken Engineering Library (Building 50) after each lecture and practical session. If the group decides the hold additional meetings; all group members shall agree to attend those meetings, unless if it is an emergency. All members are expected to attend the meetings. If there are circumstances in which a member is not able to attend, he/she should notify the other team members via text message or post on the Facebook group that was created when the group was formed.

Our group has agreed to use Slack and Facebook as the primary tools of communication as it is one of the most popular and easy to use communication tool nowadays. Facebook group and Slack channels were created when the group was formed. Slack and Facebook group should be checked at least once every 36 hours to ensure every group member is up-to-date. If a group member is unreachable by Slack or Facebook then they will be contacted by phone and email. In the event of needing to schedule a meeting outside of class, it must be done with at least 48 hours notice and be scheduled to have the most available members to attend.
Google docs were created to share files and folders within the team. Google docs were selected as it was the most convenient tool for collaboration documents. The naming conventions we will be using is combining the name of the document and the date it was created/modified. Github will be used for storing code files as it supports distributed version controls and source code management functionally.
  

##Plan&Milestones

|Week/Date             |Task Description and Duration   |Resource Requirements   |
|----------------------|---|---|
|Week 6 31/8 â€“ 06/9 Week 7 07/9 - 13/9|1.Data collection and personas modeling: in the initial phase we need to conduct several kinds of investigation to collect raw data from our target users.  The methodologies including context interview, questionnaire, context observation would be considered in order to get comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data. </br> 2. Idea refinement: meanwhile, in this period, we would refine our initial idea, finding the bugs in terms of usability, feasibility and interactivity. Also, we have to consider the social aspects and how to combine current technologies with basic requirements. 3.Initial documentation and proposal completion: we would refine the plan we made in this first proposal according to the reality we meet and allocate tasks to every team member based on their professional skill and preferences.| 1. To conduct the initial user research, we have to make the investigation plan according to existing experiences and guides. There are user research paradigms for the designers in https://www.usability.gov/, meanwhile, we need to create a questionnaire in Google Form. 2.To model the personas, we would employ the raw data we collect in the previous phase.  Also, if we lose some points, it is possible for us to build personas with conventional knowledge on target users.|
|Week 8 14/9 - 20/9 Week 9 21/9 - 27/9|1.Requirement analysis: we have collected raw data from our target users. In the next step, we would analyze such data and find usable information to our project as our initial user requirements. From scripts and reports of context interviews and observation and the statistics of the questionnaire, we would get relatively comprehensive data showing the qualitative and quantitative data from target users. 2.Initial technical knowledge storage: since we have made the initial plan and direction of our project, we should start to learn existing technique related to our product or prototype. The web development would be the basis of this project and meanwhile, we need to grasp the essential knowledge on a collaborative platform such as Github in order to optimize the process of our project.|1.In order to get the user requirements, we need to use the research data in the previous step and abstract essential information from narrative words of user interviews and observations. Meanwhile, from Google Form, we could get important quantitative data based on all kinds of pie charts and bar charts. 2.To learn related technical knowledge which would be used in our product or prototype, we would browse tutorial websites such as W3C school and so on. Also, we need to grasp the professional skill covering video rendering, API connection, and others to support our product or prototype.|
|Week 10 28/9 - 04/10	|1.Framework design: in this phase, our focus should be concentrated on the interaction paradigm and model of our product. In framework design phase, we would make the blueprint on the behaviors happening between users and our product. We would think of the whole workflow logically and the interaction supporting every functionality in order to create the sound and robust user experience. The initial interface design would start in this phase either. We would start the layout the elemental functional modules in the interfaces and define the connection between different modules.|	1.We would reference existing techniques on how to design for the framework of product in terms of interaction paradigm and models. 2.We need to use graphic design software such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to render the initial layout and other interface elements.|
|Week 11 05/10 - 11/10|	1. Framework refinement: in this stage, we would continually pay attention to the framework of our product and add or delete functional modules according to further research and requirements.
2.Initial prototype modeling: we would also start to model our prototype based on existing data and framework|  1. Graphic design software such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.        2. Prototype modeling software or platform such as Fluid or Visual Studio.|
|Week 12 12/10 - 18/10 Week 13 19/10 - 25/10 Week 14 26/10 - 01/11|	1.Product and prototype building: the main work of this phase is to complete our prototype and if possible, we would create is as the runnable product based on website platforms. For prototype modeling, we would employ existing website and create full interaction model and paradigm in our prototype. If we have more effort, we would decide to complete the runnable product based on HTML, javascript, and related API to realize our initial blueprint. 2.Essay completion: we would also finish the essay as the assessment in this stage.
3.Evaluation design: we would conduct user evaluation test in order to get data regarding how it can satisfy the user requirements and the expectation we set in the previous stage|	1. Graphic design software such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.   2. Prototype modeling software or platform such as Fluid or Visual Studio.|
|Week 15 02/11 - 08/11 Week16 09/11 - 15/11|	1.Evaluation analysis: we would analyze the data we collect from the user evaluation test and make conclusion on every aspect of our product.								2. Report completion: in this final stage, we would finish the final report as the result of our project|	
	

1. Research: Define project goals and schedule; Review existing product; Understand user needs and behavior 
2. Modeling: Build personas and other models
3. Requirement Definition: Build Scenarios and describe the capabilities of our product
4. Design Framework: Design elemental functional modules and basically interaction of our product
5. Design Refinement: Design detail functionalities with more consideration on our topic and the requirements from users and course 
6. Prototype: Create prototype based on our design framework and user research in the form of raw electronic modules
6. Test and Iteration: Numbers of iteration between our prototypes and final product, we would invite outsiders and insiders to test our product or prototype in order to get comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data from users

We hope that each step could be conducted successfully so that we may get the product which could satisfy our basic expectation. Meanwhile, we also expect that our project could run well in the real scenario as it would perform in our simulated context scenarios again and again.
