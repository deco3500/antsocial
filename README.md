##Summary
Locals is an online community web application that groups people based on the location/suburb that they live in. In these groups, the users are also split into different subgroups based on their interest such as sport, entertainment, business, culture and life. News that are related to that location/suburb will be posted to that group so people can get up-to-date information on what is happening around them. The user is also able to express their opinion or leave feedback in the web application. Other than news, the user can also post other messages to the web application such as garage sales, lost items or advertisements etc. on the web application for the local community.
“Armed with easy-to-use Web publishing tools, always-on connections and increasingly powerful mobile devices, the online audience has the means to become an active participant in the creation and dissemination of news and information.” (WeMedia) Locals not only present local news in a traditional way, but one of its major functionalities is that users post what they see in the news and express their opinions to share with others. It turns users into journalists in reporting news, which largely increases the news amount that users get to read.
“To comprehend journalistic value creation we need to focus on the benefits it provides.”(Why journalists deserve low pay) Nowadays, as most of the news websites focus on the content of the news, this web application focuses on the place/area in which the news/event happened and delivers this information to the user group. One of the benefits in using this application is the ability to receive news events that were not reported by the mainstream news media and receive instant updates from the people in the local area.  

##Design Process
###Research
####Research 1:
IT and social media consumption is increasing, resulting in the growth of citizen journalism. According a study of 200 blogs, Kerr et al. (2012), identified that blogs and online social media sites provided online users the power to influence and share their opinion with like-minded users. Furthermore, they found that online platforms increased the number of citizen journalists but formed an absence of impartiality.

Within decades, mobile phones have gone from calling devices to multitalented tools that complement consumers’ ability to function. Today, they can call, text, email, post, and video through the internet. The Internet has evolved from a platform originally used to facilitate info-exchanging to a suitcase of social-networks that offer virtual-content-sharing (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). It is here where technology has transformed the way journalists, institutions and consumers distribute and receive news. In fact, social media is no longer being embraced for it’s traditional use. If you go into Google and search ‘Journalism apps’, the results will shows several headings along the lines of ‘Top 10 apps that every Journalist should have’.

Mobile devices have become a common way for consumers to source information and data. Traditionally, this was achieved through online governmental or other institutional databases such as The National Archives’ Digital Archive of Data Sites. The sites originally provided users to only obtain information that was formatted. However, the sites now host forums to discuss their use of data and further relevant information. This has provided an element of interactivity, which has been well explored and used through other platforms.
According to Bradshaw & Rohumaa (2011), live data has become a useful tool for journalists to obtain information. The difference between such data is that it is not stored anywhere but is produced at a particular time, which can be useful in certain contexts. For example, newspapers are increasingly using Twitter commentary to provide background information to a debate that is current at the time.

This is certainly true in the data above that shows the social media platforms consumers use to source information on political and governmental activities in the US in 2014. As shown, Facebook was the number one site that online users relied on for receiving such news. However, a dilemma arises from this dependence on social media applications, which Bradshaw has summarized in the following questions:
- How will users filter these platforms to obtain news that is relevant and significant?
- How can information be visualized most clearly?
- How can you ensured that these platforms are not being intentionally skewed for commercial or political reasons?
- How much do you love to leave comments below the news?

####Research 2: Public Record Survey Questionnaire
The link to the survey that aims to view users’ thoughts about the accessibility of news. It will provide some insight into this issue, and if Locals would be suitable product solution.

##Current offerings:
“Locals” dedicates to provide information sorted in categories, on regional basis, and to encourage users to be the reporters by publishing comments or posting news/events. A popular news web application, BuzzFeed also allows users to customize the categories of news/articles to read. Locals provides a similar functionality as to BuzzFeed as it also sort news into categories which users may choose to read. However, BuzzFeed does not allow users to select locations of where the news occurred nor search for a specific news event in specific areas. 

###Problem Identification
- Limited source of receiving news -- mainstream news media.
- Difficult to receive news in surrounding areas -- unless something huge happens and reported by the media.
- One-way communication -- people read the news, but no interactions can be done.
- Most of the online news platforms are designed in ordinary ways.
- As most of the news events are formal, it takes time for the journalist to write up and publish the news event.

##Target audience and context of use
###Target audience 
“Locals” are aimed at people who wanted to know what news/events happening in their surrounding area and are keen to share their views with others towards the news/events. For example, these people can be students who wanted to know what events are happening in their school/uni. They can open the web application, register/sign in,  choose the location of their school/uni and view the news/events according to their interest by clicking the pins on Google map. If there are any news/events that they are interested in, they can also share their opinion about the new/event by clicking on the comment button. These students can also create new post if they see anything that they think is fun or significant and would like to share to the public. 


People who drives to work and wanted to know about the traffic conditions in certain regions can also use the app after choosing the region and selecting “Lifestyle” as the news category to read about the traffic news in that area. They can also post traffic news of their current locations to benefit other drivers. 


Travellers can also use the app to see what is happening in the place where they plan to visit by selecting the pin in Google Map and browsing through the news list. They can read the comments that are posted by other users to see how the locals view/opinion on a certain event/news.
